# timesheet-system

## Installation

To install the timesheet system, simply download the repo (either by git clone, or through github).
Then, check that you have node installed.
Once you are sure that you have node installed, install the dependencies with `npm install`.

## Running

To run the application, on linux, post installation, cd into it's directory, and run `run.sh`.
This should also work for Mac OSX.
On Windows, do the same, but run `run.bat`, instead of `run.sh`.
